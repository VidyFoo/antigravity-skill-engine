# ⚡ Antigravity Skills Engine (ASE)

> **Antigravity Skills Engine (ASE)** is a high-performance **AI agent skills library** and **workflow engine** built on AI-native cognitive architecture. It transforms a single **LLM** into an industrial-grade **expert system** with 16 tracks of specialized expertise, providing robust solutions for **document engineering**, **frontend design**, and **workflow automation**.

> **Antigravity Skills Engine (ASE)** is the ultimate **skills library** for AI agents, providing a comprehensive collection of **Claude Skills** and industrial-grade workflows. It enables seamless **expert execution** for **PDF processing**, **Excel automation**, and **full-stack development**, ensuring your AI agent performs with unmatched precision.

## 🏛️ Core Philosophy: The Trinity

ASE moves away from fragmented tool-calling in favor of a "Trinity" asset structure designed for AI cognition:

*   **Soul**: Located in `SKILL.md`, carrying the background, logic, and decision trees of the expert.
*   **Bone**: Located in `scripts/`, providing atomized, high-performance engineering tools.
*   **Flesh**: Located in `examples/`, providing best practices for the AI to learn and reuse.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Inject the Engine
Merge the `.agent/` directory into your project root.

### 2. Summon an Expert
In an LLM environment with workflow support, type:
```bash
/ase
```
The system will start "Dynamic Introspection," displaying the current expert roster and entering intent-matching mode.

## Expert Roster (16/16)

Currently pre-configured with 16 top-tier experts across four domains:

*   🎨 **Visuals & Design**: `frontend-design`, `canvas-design`, `algorithmic-art`, `theme-factory`
*   📄 **Heavy Document Engineering**: `pdf`, `docx`, `xlsx`, `pptx`, `doc-coauthoring`
*   ⚙️ **Full-stack & Tools**: `webapp-testing`, `mcp-builder`, `web-artifacts-builder`
*   🚀 **Evolution & Systems**: `skill-creator`, `internal-comms`, `brand-guidelines`, `slack-gif-creator`

## 💎 Key Features

- **Implicit Semantic Awareness**: Deeply optimized for Antigravity's cognitive architecture—maps experts accurately without exact keywords.
- **Environment-Locked Safety**: All tools are validated for "Perfect Execution" within the Antigravity container.
- **Asset Feedback Loop**: Encourages the persistence of script assets into the expert library during development.

## 📚 Attribution & Statement

The expert capabilities in this project are deeply inspired by and converted from the **Claude** series of open-source libraries (e.g., `Claude Engineer`, `Claude-Architect`).

We have performed extensive adaptation for the **Antigravity** environment to ensure **Perfect Execution**:
- **Router Rewrite**: Rebuilt intent mapping for Antigravity's specific sub-agent triggers.
- **Path Verification**: Fixed all file system and tool call paths for seamless local execution.
- **Tool Integration**: Native support for PythonRecalc, Playwright automation, and various document engines.
