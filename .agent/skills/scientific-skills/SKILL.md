# ⚡ Scientific Research Expert (Matrix)

A massive collection of **139+ specialized scientific skills** covering biology, chemistry, medicine, and research workflows.

## 🚀 Intent & Discovery

This expert acts as a **Global Router** for high-dimensional scientific tasks. Use it when users request:
- **Bio-informatics**: AlphaFold, Protein analysis, NCBI searches.
- **Chemistry**: ZINC database, SMILES processing, PubChem.
- **Data Engineering**: Vaex, Zarr, specialized hdf5 processing.
- **Academic Ops**: Venue templates, citation management, research pipelines.

## 🏛️ Structured Expert Matrix

The expert orchestrates 139 sub-modules located under `.agent/skills/scientific-skills/`. Each sub-module is a specialized expert package:

- **AlphaFold/Proteins**: Structural biology and sequence analysis.
- **ZINC/Small Molecules**: Chemical informatics and lead discovery.
- **Multi-omics**: Single-cell analysis, transcriptomics.
- **Research Ops**: Paper drafting, data visualization, bibliography.

## 🛠️ Usage Protocol

1. **Introspection**: When activated via `@/ase scientific`, this expert scans its internal matrix to suggest the best sub-domain.
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Activates specialized scripts from the `Bone` layer to interact with scientific APIs (NCBI, EBI, PDB).

## 🔒 Security & Provenance

All scientific logic is adapted from the `K-Dense` research library. We ensure **Perfect Execution** by locking dependencies within the Antigravity container and verifying all data extraction pipelines.
