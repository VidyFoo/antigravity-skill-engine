# Product Requirements Mastery

## Purpose
To bridge the gap between "I have an idea" and "Here is exactly what to build". This skill forces the Agent to think like a Product Manager before thinking like an Engineer.

## When to Use This Skill
- **Ambiguous Requests**: "Build a dashboard for me." (What kind? For whom?)
- **Feature Planning**: "Add a user leveling system."
- **Spec Writing**: Creating `spec.md` or `task.md`.
- **Scope Negotiation**: determining MVP vs Nice-to-have.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. The "Problem/Solution" First Principle
Never start with features. Start with the problem.
- **Problem**: "Users don't know if the system is working."
- **Solution**: "Add a status indicator." (Not just "Add a green light").

### 2. User Story Mapping
Don't just list tasks. Map the user's journey.
- **Backbone**: The high-level flow (e.g., "Sign Up" -> "Search" -> "Purchase").
- **Skeleton**: The steps within each flow.
- **Details**: The specific tickets/stories for each step.

### 3. The "HustleBadger" PRD Structure
A proven format for documentation:
1. **Summary**: High-level pitch.
2. **Problem**: Why are we doing this?
3. **Goals/Non-Goals**: Success metrics and scope boundaries.
4. **User Stories**: "As a [User], I want [Action], so that [Benefit]".
5. **Technical Approach**: High-level implementation strategy.
